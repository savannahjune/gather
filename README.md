gather map
=========
###### Let's Meet in the Middle.

<h5>Web app that chooses a spot between two locations that is equi-time between them. </h5>

Have you ever had trouble deciding where you and a friend should meet up for coffee when you are both coming from different locations? Or have you ever been in a new city and wondered where's the best spot for you to grab lunch with someone on the other side of the city? Worry no longer, because gather map has you covered. 

Users can specify two origin locations, transportation methods used, and desired type of location (bar, restaurant, caf√©, etc).

Gather then returns the best spot for the two people to meet at, so that they both spend the same time getting there.  A map then displays directions from each origin address to the 'gathering point' business. 
Users can then ask for a different spot nearby, if they do not want to meet at that particular establishment. The business details and map with then reload with new information.
