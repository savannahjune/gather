gather
=========
###### Let's Meet in the Middle.

<h5>Web app that chooses a spot between two locations that is equi-time between them. </h5>

Users can specify two origin locations, transportation methods used, and desired type of location (bar, restaurant, caf√©, etc).

Gather then returns the best spot for the two people to meet at, so that they both spend the same time getting there.  A map then displays directions from each origin address to the 'gathering point' business. 
Users can then ask for a different spot nearby, if they do not want to meet at that particular establishment. The business details and map with then reload with new information.
